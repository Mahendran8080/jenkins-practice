# `package.json`

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **File Purpose** | The `package.json` file is the central metadata and dependency manifest for a Node.js project. It tells Node (and npm/yarn) how to install the project’s dependencies, what scripts can be run, and provides basic project information. In this repository, it defines a minimal Express‑based application that is likely used as a test or demo service within a Jenkins CI pipeline. |
| **Key Logic** | - **`name` / `version`** – Identifies the package (`jenkins-ci`) and its current release (`1.0.0`). <br> - **`main`** – Entry point (`index.js`). <br> - **`scripts`** – Two convenience commands: <br>   * `start`: `node index.js` – launches the Express server. <br>   * `test`: a placeholder that simply echoes “No tests yet” and exits successfully. <br> - **`type`** – Declares the module system as CommonJS (`"commonjs"`). <br> - **`dependencies`** – Currently only `express` (v5.x), the web framework used by `index.js`. |
| **DevOps Context** | In a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., Jenkins), this file is used to: <br> 1. **Install Dependencies** – `npm install` or `yarn install` pulls `express` and any other packages. <br> 2. **Run Tests** – The `test` script is invoked by Jenkins’ “Run unit tests” step. Although it’s a stub, it can be replaced with real test commands (e.g., `jest`, `mocha`). <br> 3. **Start the Application** – The `start` script can be used in a “Deploy” or “Run integration tests” stage to spin up the service. <br> 4. **Docker Integration** – If a Dockerfile references `npm ci` or `npm install`, this file ensures the container image contains the correct dependencies. <br> 5. **Versioning & Release** – The `name` and `version` fields can be leveraged by Jenkins to tag Docker images or publish npm packages. |

> **Tip for CI**:  
> - Replace the placeholder `test` script with real unit tests.  
> - Add a `prestart` script if you need to perform linting or build steps before launching the server.  
> - Consider adding a `build` script if you plan to transpile TypeScript or bundle assets.
